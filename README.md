99% unfinished projects.
Containing my first Java projects, school projects and random stuff i can't remember + 3rd party Libraries I was too lazy to add to the gitignore.
You'll have to compile them by yourself.
Interesting projects:

 - Curve Fever (like the browser game)
 - Computer control (client/server application to controll someones computer)
 - hungry-cells (not sure if finished, client/server game copy of agar.io)
 - Snake/Snake2.0 (snake, idk)
 - Zombie (multiplayer client/server "game", you are a rectangle that can shoot + first lighting rendering)

Other interesting projects that aren't as cool as the ones above:

 - 3DTesting (random lwjgl rendering testing)
 - GameOfLife (with bad performance)
 - Terrario (rectangle with some basic lighting and some overcomplicated texture calculation)
 - Web game (java applet, block break game)
 - Quadtree (simple collision testing with a drivable car and structure generation)
